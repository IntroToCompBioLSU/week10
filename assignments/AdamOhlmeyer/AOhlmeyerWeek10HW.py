#- [ ] Refactor your population growth simulation to use objects that you define.
# Include these object types:
 #  Individual
  #- Generation
  # Simulation
  # Each of these object types should have at least one property (variable) and one method
  # Your Simulation class should have a `run()` method, so that you can run an entire simulation just by calling that method.
